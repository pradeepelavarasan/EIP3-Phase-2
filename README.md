## Steps Involved:

1. Selecting the book required. You can select the choices from https://www.gutenberg.org/
2. Formatting the data
3. Building small LSTM network to learn the sequence of characters used in the book
4. Generating new text using the trained LSTM network

For more detailed steps you can refer to the below reference link.
